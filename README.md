## Hi, I’m Yana 👋

I’m a Computer Science student in UC Davis with an interest in applied technology, systems, and analytical roles. I enjoy understanding how technology works at a high level and how it can be used to solve real world problems.

### Goals

### Interests
- Applied computer science
- Systems and technology analysis
- Problem-solving and organization
- Learning how software and tools work together

### Skills
- Basic programming experience
- GitHub and version control
- Technical problem-solving
- Clear communication and teamwork

### Projects
I’m currently building and organizing projects as part of my coursework and learning process. More projects will be added as I continue developing my skills.

### What I’m looking for
Entry-level roles or internships in tech-related fields that focus on systems, analysis, coordination, or support rather than heavy software development.

### Fun Fact
