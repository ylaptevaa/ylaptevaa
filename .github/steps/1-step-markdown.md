# Step 1: Learning a markup language

Let's learn `Markdown`, our first new language of the course!

## 📖 Theory: What is a markup language?

`Markdown` is a simple, light-weight markup language, or a language that defines the structure, design, and purpose of plain-text within a file. There are many benefits to using simple markup languages from:

1. creating future-proof, universal documentation,
2. rapidly generating file types like PDF, HTML, DOCX, LaTeX, or even slide files (revealjs),
3. low friction writing without the distractions of a mouse, GUI, or more complex programming behavior,
4. the source files (.md) are human-readable unlike more complex markup languages like HTML or LaTeX.
