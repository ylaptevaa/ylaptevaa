# Step 2: Building a Digital portfolio

A digital portfolio is a collection of materials organized and maintained by the user to showcase their breadth and depth of knowledge. This portfolio should highlight not only their technical skills, but their other pursuits. From music and art to teaching and course design. A digital portfolio allows a user to define their digital presence and leverage their skills to highlight their interests and aptitudes!

GitHub is well integrated into the open-source software culture. Having a profile easily found and well-maintained on GitHub is an excellent way to begin highlighting interesting projects you are maintaining, contributating to, or developing yourself.
