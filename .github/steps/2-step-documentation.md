# Step 2: Documenting a project

The overall success of a project is founded in how well the project is documented. Studious, well-maintained, and moderated records of every aspect of a project allow:

- Quick on-boarding of new users
- Reproducible examples for experienced users
- Simplified expansion of a project into new areas
- Defensible decision making for project development

Excellent documentation facilitates a community to grow around any project. This is an innately equitability challenge. We write our documentation in the hopes of de-mystify the inexperenced. Without clear and exact written materials, a community would lack alignment and focus leading to bloat, fracturing, or project death.

Even in scientific publications, a well-crafted story published in a respectable journal is expected to publish the code and data behind the work they publish. If the project repository is poorly documented and the work can not be replicated, the project will not be used, citations will drag, and the project will lack expansion.

## 📖 Theory: What is a [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) file?

The naming convention of a file titled `README` is a holdover from the 1970s. It began as a standard way of describing the contents of whatever directory it was housed in.

A simple landscape of project documentation:

- README = project documentation
    - An introduction and overview of a project
    - If expanded documentation is necessary, any number of directories can house a single README as a directory overview file.
- metadata = data documentation
    - data file explaining the data
- report = result documentation
    - a summary of the output for community/stakeholders
- issues, pull requests, commit messages
    - bug reports, software development

## ⌨️ Activity: Create a README.md file!

This README file is unique to your GitHub Profile page. What is written in this repo will populate on the landing page of your GitHub Profile. Think of it as a README for you! Use it as an introduction and overview of you. [Here is my profile page as an example](https://github.com/ccbaumler/ccbaumler).

On that note, I have lovingly removed the README file that existed in this repo. You now have a void to fill... You're welcome! 

1. Now, create a new README.md file in your repository's root:

    - Click on the `Code` tab

      ![readme code](https://github.com/ccbaumler/building-a-github-profile/blob/main/images/readme-code.png?raw=true)

    - Create a new file

      ![add readme file](https://github.com/ccbaumler/building-a-github-profile/blob/main/images/readme-addfile.png?raw=true)

    - Name the new file `README.md`

      ![name readme readme](https://github.com/ccbaumler/building-a-github-profile/blob/main/images/readme-namereadme.png?raw=true)

    - Add some personal text to the file

      ![readme content](https://github.com/ccbaumler/building-a-github-profile/blob/main/images/readme-text.png?raw=true)

    - Click `Commit changes` and add a `Commit message`

      ![readme content](https://github.com/ccbaumler/building-a-github-profile/blob/main/images/readme-commit.png?raw=true)

    That's it! You have created a file, edited the contents, and commited your changes to the repository.

2. Finally, write a comment in this issue that links to the README.md file in root.
